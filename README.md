30.11.2014 (5 semester) I've made a decision:

No more "mywork.7z", "labs.rar", "report.doc", "stolencode.cpp"

Just folders of the following types:

1. C++ projects ( https://code.google.com/p/cpp-project-template/ )
2. LaTex projects ( TexMaker + TexLive )
3. Random stuff which can be easily interpreted (mb C++ Qt project, *.pdf files, etc.)
